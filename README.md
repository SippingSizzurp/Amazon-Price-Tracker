# Amazon Price Alert

## Project Overview
The Amazon Price Alert project is a Python script designed to monitor the price of a specific product on Amazon. When the price falls below a predetermined threshold, the script automatically sends an email alert to the user. This utility is particularly useful for tracking price drops on desired products, enabling users to make timely purchases at the best possible price.

## Goal
The primary goal of this project is to automate the process of tracking a product's price on Amazon and to notify the user promptly when the product is available at a lower price.

## Reasoning
Regularly checking the price of a product can be tedious and time-consuming. This project simplifies the process by automating the price tracking and notification procedure, ensuring that users don't miss out on potential savings.

## How It Works
1. **URL and Price Threshold Setup**: The user specifies the URL of the Amazon product and the desired buy price threshold in the script.
2. **Web Scraping**: The script uses `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to scrape the product's current price from the Amazon webpage.
3. **Price Comparison**: The scraped price is compared with the user-defined threshold.
4. **Email Alert**: If the current price is lower than or equal to the threshold, the script sends an email alert to the user.

## Code Explanation
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `requests`: For sending HTTP requests to the Amazon product page.
  - `BeautifulSoup` from `bs4`: For parsing HTML and extracting the necessary data (product price and title).
  - `lxml`: Used as a parser for BeautifulSoup.
- **Script Flow**:
  1. **Setting Up the URL and Headers**: The script starts by defining the URL of the product and headers to mimic a browser request.
  2. **HTTP Request**: It sends a GET request to the Amazon product page.
  3. **HTML Parsing**: The response is parsed to extract the product price and title using BeautifulSoup.
  4. **Price Processing**: The price is processed and converted into a floating-point number for comparison.
